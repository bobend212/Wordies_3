## Wordies (C#)
##### C#, WinForms and Entity Framework with SQL SMS17 (Model-first convention).

Desktop application written for learning english vocabulary.

### Note
Similar application I've written in Java more than year ago and now I want improve this application, add more features, 
use relational tables with SQL and Entity Framework etc.

Now I have MVP version of the application:
1. We can create word lists and adding words in them.
2. We have one way for learning words. Read-Write way with scoring system.

## Todo list:
- add more learn ways
- implement save/load system
- add loading words from excel, text files or others sources to the application and database
- improve sql tables and relations
- improve look and feel the whole application
- add learn history and statistics history
